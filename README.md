Lessons Learned:
Before developing this app, I had no idea what React Native was besides the information that was taught in class and even then it was still a bit confusing when trying to work with it. This was my 2nd app and I already knew how I should structure/design the app, but not so much about how to code it in React. As I worked with developing the app, I recognized a lot of similarities with Java as mentioned in class and it was easier to work with than Java. Through this app, I used programmatic UI style rather than having the screen and functionality separated. This helped me understand more about the benefits of creating an app this way and I felt like I was able to understand more of what each line was doing than if I did it separately, but I also didn't get to see my interface until the code was working. This app made it apparent that unlike Android and iOS, a lot of the capabilities it has isn't already built-in by the software, but rather it's more so about importing from community contributions, which gives a lot more variety and resources than Android/iOS. The community contribution aspect is much more important in React.
